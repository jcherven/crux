#Crux

Crux is cron's best friend; a semantic cron expression helper.

Do you like crontab? It's nice and you can do a lot of helpful things with it thanks to its clever scheduling syntax.

Crafting crontab entries can be a little bit faster and a bit less dangerous. Improperly written cron jobs can really mess things up in ways that are hilarious, and also ways that are far from hilarious.

Crux will be a novel way to create cron expressions semantically. A simple MERN application that will allow me to use plain language for the creation of a clean, tidy, and safe crontab entry.

## Features:
- Craft your crontab expression in simple language:
  - On this day of this month at this time
  - Every x days
  - From x time to y time during these days
  - (We'll see what else I come up with)
- Sign in to an account so you can save and recall your favorite cron expressions
- Share crontab expressions with others, and see some clever cron expressions others have saved
- More if this turns out to work okay and be a good idea

After deciding to make this, I found that there are at least two other crontab expression helpers that are both quite good and quite different from one another in UX and features:
- [Corntab](http://corntab.com)
- [Crontab Guru](https://crontab.guru)
Crux will also be quite different in UX, hopefully for the better.
